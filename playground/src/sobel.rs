/// # Arguments
///
/// * `data` - A slice of `u8` representing the input grayscale image data.
/// * `output` - A mutable slice of `f32` where the output will be stored.
/// * `rows` - The number of rows in the image.

///
/// # Panics
///
/// This function will panic if the length of `data` or `output` is less than `rows * cols`.
